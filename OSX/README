[Makefile]
	Having issues compiling Python modules/eggs/code on OSX 10.6.x? 
	Are they 2.5.x modules?
	Are you getting one of these error messages?:
		* Compiling with an SDK that doesn't seem to exist: /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk
		* cc1: error: unrecognized command line option "-Wno-long-double"
		* lipo: can't figure out the architecture type of...
		* Building for Intel with Mac OS X Deployment Target < 10.4 is invalid
		* error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
	
	If so, then use this Makefile.
		- Replace your python Makefile with this while backing up your existing one. 
		  For example:
		  <shell>
			git clone git://github.com/JasonGiedymin/Pyramid-Scripts.git
			#or do a git archive master | tar -x -C <path> without having to clone

			cp /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.5/config/Makefile \
			/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.5/config/Makefile.orig

			cp Pyramid-Scripts/OSX/Makefile \
			/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.5/config/
		  </shell>
